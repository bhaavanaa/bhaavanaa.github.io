title:  Graph-based Text Summarization and its Application on COVID-19 Twitter Data
---

Visible, invisible,  
A fluctuating charm,  
An amber-colored amethyst  
Inhabits it; your arm  
Approaches, and  
It opens and  
It closes;  
You have meant  
To catch it,  
And it shrivels;  
You abandon  
Your intent—  
It opens, and it  
Closes and you  
Reach for it—  
The blue  
Surrounding it  
Grows cloudy, and  
It floats away  
From you.
