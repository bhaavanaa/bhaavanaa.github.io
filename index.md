I am a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur under Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar. I am currently working on question answering tasks for low resource languages. My research interest is centered around the idea of mimicking and emulating human language to build impactful applications.

  <span style="width:75%; height:auto; display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;font-size:large; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"><b>[January 2022 - May 2022]</b> Studied the state-of-the-art works related to text generation and text infilling. I worked on GPT-2 for performing natural language infilling through the generative objective. I proposed a novel approach for masked language modeling and pretraining of ELECTRA for performing sentence infilling through the discriminative objective.</span>
