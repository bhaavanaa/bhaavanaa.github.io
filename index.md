I am a Research Assistant at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur under Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar. I am currently working on question answering tasks for low resource languages. My research interest is centered around the idea of mimicking and emulating human language to build impactful applications.

I recently graduated with distinction from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, Kancheepuram in Computer Engineering.

◦ Studied the state-of-the-art works related to text generation and text infilling, and explored short stories and multi-turn
dialogue datasets to train the models to perform this task.
◦ Worked on GPT-2 for performing natural language infilling through the generative objective.
◦ Proposed and implemented a novel approach for masked language modeling and pretraining of ELECTRA for performing
sentence infilling through the discriminative objective.University of Technology and Design" style="max-width:90%; height:auto; object-fit: contain; margin:auto;"></span>
