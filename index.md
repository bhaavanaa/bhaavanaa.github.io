The background workings of the various simple but highly beneficial applications we come across everyday, such as autocorrection, predictive typing, and email spam filtering have always piqued my interest, and this curiosity escalated especially after I began my undergraduate studies in computer engineering. I enjoyed sketching an abstract logical map in my mind about how such applications might possibly function. I was particularly more inclined towards dealing with text since it felt more challenging due to its complex and individualistic nature. The idea of mimicking and emulating human language to build impactful applications compelled me to explore this field further. This drove me towards my internships in the domain of natural language processing, and my experiences motivated me to apply to Graduate school for Computer Science with focus on NLP.

  <span style="width:70%; height:auto; display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;font-size:large;"><b>[2022-Present]</b> Studied the state-of-the-art works related to text generation and text infilling, and explored short stories and multi-turn dialogue datasets to train the models to perform this task. I worked on GPT-2 for performing natural language infilling through the generative objective. I also proposed and implemented a novel approach for masked language modeling and pretraining of ELECTRA for performing sentence infilling through the discriminative objective.</a></span>
